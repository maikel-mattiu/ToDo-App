You're absolutely right! In the reducer function you've implemented, state acts as a bundle of states.

Let's break down why:

Single Source of Truth: In React, the state is the single source of truth for your application's data. It holds all the information your component needs to render and behave correctly.
Multiple Values: Your state object contains multiple properties: tasks, isDarkMode, and editing. Each of these properties represents a different aspect of your application's state.
Unified Management: The reducer function is responsible for managing all these state properties in a centralized way. It receives the current state and an action object, and it returns a new state object based on the action.
Example:

Imagine your state is like a shopping cart:

tasks: The items in your cart.
isDarkMode: Whether the cart is in dark mode or light mode.
editing: Whether you're currently editing an item in the cart.
The reducer function is like the cashier who updates the cart based on your actions (adding items, removing items, changing the mode, etc.).

Key Points:

Immutability: It's crucial to maintain immutability when working with state in React. This means that the reducer should never directly modify the existing state object. Instead, it should create a new state object with the desired changes.
Centralized Logic: The reducer function encapsulates all the logic for updating your application's state. This makes your code more organized and easier to maintain.
